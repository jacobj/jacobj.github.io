The name Evernote has become increasingly common especially amongst students. It’s an all in one information storage smorgasbord that’s available on nearly every platform. I was a fairly happy user of it for around 2.5 years (despite lack of Linux support) until around last week.

I always had this huge beef with Evernote because it didn’t take and store notes in plaintext and I hated having to rely on a proprietary application just to view some text. I was reading up on note taking apps, and came across a little gem called Notational Velocity. It’s a note taking app that stores everything in plain text, works great with Dropbox and Simplenote, and is entirely keyboard driven.

Needless to say, I’m in love.

Note: I’d like to see a Vim plugin that works like notational velocity, for when I’m on a Linux box. Though I’m starting to believe it can be achieved with ctrlp and a good markdown preview window.

Note 2: I’m actually using nvALT, which is a fork of Notational Velocity with some more added niceties.
