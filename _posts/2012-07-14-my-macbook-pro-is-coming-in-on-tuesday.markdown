I’m really excited to upgrade from my old Compaq laptop (which I interchangeably ran Ubuntu and Arch Linux on).

I chose the Macbook over the Thinkpad X1 Carbon mainly because of OS X. I’ve never been comfortable with Windows ever since I really got in to using Linux full time. In Windows, I always yearn for the power supplied by a Unix command line. OS X sounded like the most logical choice for a developer/designer that needs to use Unix while still being able to run the Adobe creative suite for design work.
