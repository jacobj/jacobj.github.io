I recently spoke in front of a little over 100 people on the basic principles of
using git and Github with a team. It was my first tech talk and it was a great
deal of fun. The slides can be found below! Keep in mind, they're targeted
mostly toward git begginers and were presented after two basic introductions to
git and Github.
