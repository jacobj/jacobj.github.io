I am an undergraduate computer science student at the University of Florida. My
interests include web development, distributed systems, cryptography, and
Unix/Linux server administration.

I currently work at a small startup in Gainesville, Florida that's working on a secure platform for researchers.

In my spare time I make music with [wpatcs.](http://wpatcs.bandcamp.com) I also
waste multiple hours playing around with my MicroKorg synthesizer. You can check
out what I've been listening to lately over at my
[last.fm](http://www.last.fm/user/xyzodiac). Weirdly enough, I also like
programing [1](/projects) [2](https://github.com/jacobj).

My resume can be found
[here.](https://www.dropbox.com/s/gf9n2fvs3jplrl0/Resume.pdf) It's not out of date as of February of 2016.

In case you need to email me privately, my PGP key can be found [here.](key.asc)
