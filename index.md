<img src="img/me.jpg" width="200" align="left" style="padding-right:20px;"> I am
a fourth-year undergraduate computer science student at the University of
Florida. My interests include web development, databases, applied mathematics,
and Unix/Linux server administration.

In my spare time I make music with [wpatcs.](http://wpatcs.bandcamp.com) and
[Cauchy-Schwarz](http://cauchy-schwarz.bandcamp.com/). I also waste multiple
hours playing around with my MicroKorg synthesizer. You can check out what I've
been listening to lately over at my [last.fm](http://www.last.fm/)

My resume can be found [here.](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/11061210/Resume.pdf)

In case you need to email me privately, my PGP key can be found [here.](key.asc)
My fingerprint is:
