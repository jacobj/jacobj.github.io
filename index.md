Hey! I'm Jacob Jenkins. My interests include web development, distributed systems,
cryptography, and Unix/Linux server administration.

I'm currently working at Buoy Health in Boston. We're trying to change healthcare for the better.

In my spare time I make music with [wpatcs.](http://wpatcs.bandcamp.com) I also
waste multiple hours playing around with my MicroKorg synthesizer. You can check
out what I've been listening to lately over at my
[last.fm](http://www.last.fm/user/xyzodiac). Weirdly enough, I also like
programming [[1](/projects)][[2](https://github.com/jacobj)].

My resume can be found
[here.](https://www.dropbox.com/s/apwc8uao7rk6tol/Jacob%20Jenkins%20Resume.pdf?dl=0) It's not out of
date as of February of 2016.

In case you need to email me privately, my PGP key can be found [here.](key.asc)
My fingerprint is:
