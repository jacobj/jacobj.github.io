<img src="img/me.jpg" width="200" align="left" style="padding-right:20px;"> I am
a fifth-year undergraduate computer science student at the University of
Florida. My interests include web development, distributed systems,
cryptography, and Unix/Linux server administration.

I currently work at a small startup in Gainesville, Florida that's working on a
secure file-sharing and virtualization platform.

In my spare time I make music with [wpatcs.] I also waste multiple hours playing
around with my MicroKorg synthesizer. You can check out what I've been listening
to lately over at my [last.fm](http://www.last.fm/)

My resume can be found
[here.](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/11061210/Resume.pdf) It's probably
out of date.

In case you need to email me privately, my PGP key can be found [here.](key.asc)
My fingerprint is:
