I am a fourth year computer science student at the University of Florida. My
interests include web development, databases, applied mathematics, and
Unix/Linux server administration.

In my spare time I make music with [wpatcs.](http://wpatcs.bandcamp.com) and
[Cauchy-Schwarz](http://cauchyschwarz.bandcamp.com). I also waste multiple hours
playing around with my MicroKorg synthesizer.

My resume can be found [here.](img/Resume.pdf)
