Hey! I'm Jacob. I'm a software engineer, recovering painter, musician, and bad content creator living in Boston, MA.

I'm currently working at [Buoy Health](https://buoyhealth.com). We're trying to change healthcare for the better.

I used to make music with [wpatcs](http://wpatcs.bandcamp.com). Now I'm working on a new [solo project](https://chrysippusdiedlaughing.bandcamp.com). You can check out what I've been listening to lately over at my [last.fm](http://www.last.fm/user/xyzodiac). You can also find me on [soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/lazyedit). Weirdly enough, I also like programming [[1](/projects)][[2](https://github.com/jacobj)].

My resume can be found
[here.](https://www.dropbox.com/s/apwc8uao7rk6tol/Jacob%20Jenkins%20Resume.pdf?dl=0) It's nearly a year out of date.

In case you need to email me privately, my PGP key can be found [here.](key.asc)
My fingerprint is:
